- I did make user schema , student schema, and class Schema

- user need to register and  login first , after then he can access class routes and student routes. 

- Only teacher can create class , to implement this I am checking role of user by creating a middleware.

- I am using bcrypt library to hash password of user

- Using jsonwebtoken library to create token , so that user can login with credentials. 

- Through mongoose we can connect server to mongodb database.
